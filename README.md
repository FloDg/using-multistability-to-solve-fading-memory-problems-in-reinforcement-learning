# Using multistability to solve fading memory problems in reinforcement learning

This repository contains the code used in my master thesis, i.e. “Using multistability to solve fading memory problems in reinforcement learning”.

The directories ``tmaze`` and ``xortmaze`` contain the scripts used to run the tests on these two environments.
